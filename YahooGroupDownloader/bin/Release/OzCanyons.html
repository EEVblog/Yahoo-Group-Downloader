<DIV><FONT size=2>Hi there,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Thanks for inviting me in this group. I am a member of the ACA e-group but live and work (as a canyoning guide) in Europe.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>This invitation came right in time because you guys might be able to help me out.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>One of our guides works part time for us, part time for humanitarian aid organisations. For the moment he's doing a 6-month stint in Indonesia in&nbsp;a refugee camp. Because his mind is never far from canyoning, he has asked me to look on the web for information about canyoning in that region.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>I figure that you might have some information regarding canyons in the Indonesia/Java region ? Everything helps.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Thanks in advance,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

As a personal opinion I think the technical skills associated with<BR>abseiling and rigging a canyon &amp; difficult abseils are mandatory. What is<BR>specifically taught depends on the grade &amp; specific canyon/s that you will<BR>be visiting. Of course the use of full safety equipment including helmets &amp;<BR>gloves should be taught &amp; demonstrated, also specifics such as group<BR>management/strong briefings (kids like to race around) and special attention<BR>should be paid to hypothermia management as kids are particularly<BR>susceptible, especially if there is a delay enroute.<BR>Minimal impact technique &amp; natural history should be major components of<BR>what is provided to the kids, to inspire them and encourage respect for our<BR>wild places. All leaders should be familiar with the area, canyon (incl<BR>early exits), local weather &amp; recent weather happenings, map &amp; navigation.<BR>And so the list goes on... Any other opinions? Organised &amp; or commercial<BR>guiding is a very technical field...<BR>Regards,<BR>Lee</DIV></td>

The new book looks at five <BR>different areas that are Blue Mountains, Karijini, Bungle Bungles, <BR>Kimberly's &amp; Central Australia. Some excellent pics and some <BR>excellent expeditions, many of the outback ones by helicopter!<BR>I will probably be able to supply the book in a few weeks, it is not <BR>yet released.<BR>Anyone out on the weekend?<BR>There were a HEAP of cars at the Dalpura departure point, a few <BR>horrific accidents along the bells line of road in the last 4 days, <BR>one of my friends was first at the scene of a fatality...

<td colspan="3" style = "border: 2px solid #000;"><DIV id=ygrps-yiv-1828252722>Hi all,<BR><BR>From Lee's recent mail, it appears commercial guides feel a need to<BR>justify their occupations, perhaps due to their perception by the<BR>general canyoning community. <BR><BR>There is no getting away from the tendency of humans to vainly compare<BR>themselves with one another. The two different 'species' of canyoners<BR>found in the wilderness exist for different reasons: <BR><BR>The 'recreational canyoning group' makes the pilgrimage up to the<BR>canyons in search of adventure, challenge and escape. The 'commercial<BR>canyoning guide' is accompanied by an entourage of 'bumbly' tourists<BR>and brings them up to the canyon in order to extract money from them.<BR><BR>Really, would the commercial guides still do it if there wasn't a<BR>dollar to be made?<BR><BR>Re: Lee's comments:<BR><BR>The need for skills to 'properly guide' is required only if groups go<BR>canyoning in the 'guide/client' mould. <BR><BR>The mentality of most volunteer groups is that people are<BR>progressively taught skills to look after themselves. They learn how<BR>to belay each other, set up ropes, hook themselves up(!), and move<BR>past being 'passengers' to becoming accountable for themselves. When<BR>you take money from someone on a trip, you become accountable for<BR>their safety, and must have the skills. <BR><BR>There is no doubt that guides possess more technical skills than the<BR>average canyoner. And that the client has a more gourmet lunch<BR>provided for them than the average canyoner. Some of my friends are<BR>guides, and they spend their working hours in a beautiful wilderness<BR>environment. But rarely is there the opportunity for us to canyon<BR>together.<BR><BR>Just remember that humans are still just a part of nature. And in<BR>nature, diversity provides a healthy cross-section of 'species' that<BR>can coexist.<BR><BR>So instead of pointing out each others' weaknesses in an attempt to<BR>boost our own egos, let's take a note from the mailing list's very own<BR>introduction, and be 'productive'.<BR><BR>Re: Dave's comments:<BR><BR>Can any commercial operators illuminate us as to whether any tracks to<BR>canyons have been cut? I'm sure they'd just be worn by use.<BR>Especially if a group of 50 people went through!! <BR><BR>In the short 8 years I have been canyoning, I now see that canyons<BR>could be separated out into 'sport' and 'bush' categories. The<BR>creation of the cut-off gates in Newnes forest is a most excellent<BR>opportunity to choose an isolated 'bush' canyon. Just like you can<BR>now climb at abandoned cliffs like Boyce and Zig Zag because everyone<BR>is into sport climbing! <BR><BR>For people who'd like to know where the distinction lies in canyoning,<BR>it can be approximated by checking out where the commercial groups go<BR>regularly:<BR><BR>ASM: www.ozemail.com.au/~atlwp/canyon.htm<BR>Rocksports: www.rocksports.com.au/discus/messages/92/93.html?976184605<BR>Outland: www.outland.com.au/canyon.htm<BR>High n Wild: www.high-n-wild.com.au/can.htm<BR>Bushsports: www.bushsports.com.au/canyoning.html<BR>RopeWerx: www.hermes.net.au/ropewerx/canyons<BR><BR>Extra info is available on Dave's overview page:<BR><BR>www.ozemail.com.au/~dnoble/canyonlist2.html<BR><BR>Last weekend's canyoning action for myself included Empress (no-one in<BR>sight) and Water Dragon (not a soul).
