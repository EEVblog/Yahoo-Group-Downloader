I am all to familiar with the very <BR>diverse and passionate discussions and opinions that crop up amongst <BR>Canyoners in the bush and wherever we may meet... This is the first <BR>post to the list and just like a new pair of Volleys i thought it <BR>should be broken in, just how do you 'devirginise' an e-group, i know <BR>that with Volleys it is ritual for every member of the Canyoning <BR>party to jump on your white, shiny shoes at the departure point (or <BR>at least make a smart, defamatory remark about them!). They then must <BR>be tramped through the depths of a Canyon and back out again before <BR>they are accepted into the group as a normal member of the Canyoning <BR>community.<BR>Amongst Volleys, as in Byron Bay, the older, daggier, dirtier and <BR>more bits you have hanging off you, the more respected you are <BR>amongst your peers, until one day you finally fall completely to <BR>pieces after a hard life of usually 25 or so Canyons and 600-1500 k's <BR>of walking, swimming, abseiling, jumping, bouncing around in the back <BR>of old cars and hanging off the washing line You are discarded into <BR>the wheelie bin. unceremoniously, discarded. To be replaced, often <BR>before your time by a new, bright &amp; shiny pair of Classic Volleys <BR>from Dunlop...<BR>Ah the life of a Volley!<BR>Better get back to work!<BR>Lee<BR>www.naturetours.com.au</DIV></td>

<DIV><FONT size=2>Hi there,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Thanks for inviting me in this group. I am a member of the ACA e-group but live and work (as a canyoning guide) in Europe.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>This invitation came right in time because you guys might be able to help me out.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>One of our guides works part time for us, part time for humanitarian aid organisations. For the moment he's doing a 6-month stint in Indonesia in&nbsp;a refugee camp. Because his mind is never far from canyoning, he has asked me to look on the web for information about canyoning in that region.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>I figure that you might have some information regarding canyons in the Indonesia/Java region ? Everything helps.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Thanks in advance,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Koen</FONT></DIV></DIV></td>
